# Path to the shippable part of your application
# The shippable part of your application should contain manifest files
# (requirements.txt in case of pip, pyproject.toml and poetry.lock in case of
# Poetry) and the actual source that you will want to run inside of your
# container.

# The working directory will contain the home directory that is mounted into
# the Docker container, package caches and other artifacts that may be be used
# to aid in development.

# Docker stage to build in case of a multi-stage build
# Defaults to the build stage when undefined as it is fair to assume that
# manually invoking GNU Make rules is likelier to happen from a software
# developer's workstation as opposed to a production build environment and
# therefore the ability to spawn a working build/development environment with
# minimal manual effort renders this design choice sensible.

# Version to use for tagging images
# By default the PROJECT_VERSION and RUNTIME_VERSION are factored into the
# VERSION variable such that RUNTIME_VERSION is part of the pre-release clause.
# The reason the build metadata was not utilized in this case is because Docker
# does not allow for tags containing build metadata clauses since plus-signs
# (+) are technically not allowed in Docker tags.
